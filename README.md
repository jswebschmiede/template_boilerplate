## Usage

### Development Mode

To work in development mode and benefit from automatic reloading and copying the files to your Joomla installation:

-   install the component in Joomla (see Production Mode)
-   configure the `webpack.config.js` file with the path to your Joomla installation (default is `../../joomla`)
-   folder structure should look like this. You can change the names of the folders, important is only the structur itself.

```
joomla_dev/
    - joomla/
    - joomla_components/
        - template_boilerplate/
```

-   start the development server:

```
pnpm run dev
```

### Production Mode

To create a production-ready version of your template:

```
pnpm run build
```

This creates an optimized version of the template and packages it into a ZIP file for installation in Joomla.
